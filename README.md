# Color Picker (C#) - Minimalist UI

This is a project of a simple color picker made with C# WinForm app, featuring a minimalist interface for easy understanding and simple code.

You can just drag the trackbar to the value that you want and than just click on the RGB or HEX value! â˜º

Feel free to edit it and do as you please. The intention will always be to contribute in some way with you all. If you have any suggestions, just open a fork and make your modifications! Thank you!
